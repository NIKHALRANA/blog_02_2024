            <time>November 13, 2024</time>
            <p>Researchers from Johns Hopkins and Stanford Universities have advanced autonomous robotic surgery using imitation learning, enabling a robot to learn surgical techniques from a large collection of recorded procedures rather than being programmed step-by-step. This approach holds promise for reducing medical errors and improving surgical precision, marking a significant step forward in autonomous robotic surgeries.</p>
